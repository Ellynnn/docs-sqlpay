## Process pending claims, or commission for resigned staff after resign date

- In scenarios where a staff resigns in this current month but they have pending commissions, or claims that will only be distributed in the following month, how to we process these transactions?

- For example, the picture below shows that staff has resign on 15/07/2021. There is 1 pending commission transaction for 31/08/2021. How do we process this?

## Introduction

- CP38 is a **instruction** to Deduct Salary which **issued by LHDN**. This CP38 instruction requires that the employer **make additional deductions in monthly installments** from the salary of the taxpayer (other than a Monthly Tax Deduction) towards settlement of taxpayerâ€™s income tax arrears.
- The Salary Deduction Order (CP38) for tax payment in instalments aims to ease the burden **of the taxpayer** who should be paying the tax arrears in one lump sum under the Income Tax Act 1967.

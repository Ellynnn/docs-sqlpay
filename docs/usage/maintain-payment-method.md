## Introduction

- Maintain Payment Method helps you to categorise how you want to pay your employee
- This is useful when you have different type of banks (MBB, HLB & etc) and method of paying (Cash, Cheque, Transfer)
- At here, we can also set the **auto rounding** so that all payout is round to the nearest 5 cent
    eg: Employee total pay = RM1234.**56**
    After auto rounding, it will become RM1234.**55**
